## 💡 How It Works

- **Local Development:** Uses `.env.local` file
- **Production (Vercel):** Uses environment variable you set in Vercel
- **Cost:** ~$0.04 per image
- **Rate Limit:** 10 free images per day per user (with your key, unlimited)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to generate image"
- Check that API key is added in Vercel dashboard
- Make sure you redeployed after adding the key
- Check OpenAI dashboard for credits: https://aistudio.google.com/

### "Invalid API key"
- Double-check the key in Vercel matches exactly
- No extra spaces before/after the key
- Key should start with `sk-proj-`

### Still not working?
- Check Vercel function logs in dashboard
- Make sure the deployment finished successfully
- Try generating a fresh deployment
