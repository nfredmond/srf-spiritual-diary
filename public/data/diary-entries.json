I will lay myself, with all my prejudices and pettiness, with all the flesh holds dear, upon the burning pyre. I will lift my heart daily to Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, and my Guru Paramahansa Yoganandaji, asking for their many-jewelled gifts of Self-realization. In the stillness of night, out of the depth of my heart I will cry: \"Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth. \" When the call to disagreeable duty is sounded, I will answer, \"Here am I, Lord; send me.\"",

Yet when the field of consciousness is cleared, and sown with seeds of good qualities, plants of noble activities sprout forth, yielding abundantly the fruits of real happiness. Above all, have patience to seek communion with God through deep meditation and to become acquainted with your indestructible soul, hidden within your perishable earthly body.",
